If you wish to see the remote jacoco reporting, add jacocoagent.jar to $TOMCAT_HOME/lib and ensure the tomcat environment has CATALINA_OPTS set:

CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Xmx2048m -Xms2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -javaagent:/usr/local/thirdparty/jakarta-tomcat/lib/jacocoagent.jar=append=false,dumponexit=false,output=tcpserver,address=*,port=6300,excludes=com.example.excludeme.*"

Note: Jacoco dynamically instruments classes with private data. If tomcat fails to 
start or you encounter other bugs with jacoco reporting, check for code
that performs unsafe reflection (iterating through all members of a
class without validating access level) may need to be excluded or rewritten.
